We can track Expenses in the following ways:\
**Manual Entry** lets users add expenses by typing in the amount, category, and date. \
**Bank Sync** links to bank accounts or credit cards to automatically add and sort expenses. \
**Receipts Capture** allows users to take pictures of receipts to quickly log them. \
**Recurring Expenses** lets users automatically track regular payments, like rent or subscriptions.\
and we can collect the data and save it in the database. \
\
\
Expense categorization can be done in a few simple ways:  \
**Automatic Categorization** sorts expenses into categories like groceries or dining based on bank or merchant.  \
**Custom Categories** let users create their own categories to organize spending.  \
**Category Rules** let users set rules to automatically sort expenses based on keywords or merchants.  \
**Tagging** lets users add tags to transactions for more detailedÂ tracking. \
